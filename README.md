My first Repository Project
I am an old tinkerer with computers from way back. I started fooling around with computers when just two megabytes of RAM memory weighed three hundred pounds and cost fifty thousand dollars. It was called tar coil memory. We used Commodore 64's and the first personal computer was only on the market for three years and the same goes for the internet. It had only been accessible to the public for three years. I was fifteen years old and part of my job was to supervise the computer room where I worked at a planetariam. I learned BASIC programming language on my break time and to this day drivers are still written in that language. Only it's condensed into what is called short drivers so as the computer to have faster boots. I remember the first thing I did when I got out of the service was to buy a "Trash 80". That was the nick name for the 64 kilobyte color version by Tandy of the Commodore 64 and I would spend hours and hours programming that machine. My first project was a burglar alarm and planned to use two connectors in the program to hook to detectors to trigger the alarm in the event of a break in. The Tandy 80 only, like the black and white Commodore 64 only had eight pages of memory and The games that came with it were pretty primitive compared to todays power huuses.
